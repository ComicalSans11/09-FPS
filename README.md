For this project, we created a FPS inside Godot. We had to make AI enemies, a weapon, a player, and an environment. We created the model for our enemies in blender. Use WASD to move, and left click to shoot enemies. There are 5 enemies that do not respawn. There are ammo and health pickups if you get low on either. My project is based on a tutorial found at https://godottutorials.pro/fps-godot-tutorial/.
